[[_remoteDomain]]
== <grooscript:remoteModel>

With this tag you can use your domain classes in the browser / client. The domain class in available in
your groovy code and actions on that domain will be performed asynchronous in your server. You have to annotate
your domain class as a REST resource with +@Resource(uri='/anyUrl')+. The access to
the data is controlled by grails, you can use http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-rest[spring secure rest plugin]
to secure access to your data.

*This tag is still experimental, don't use in production.*

[source,groovy]
--
package rest

import grails.rest.Resource

@Resource(uri='/books')
class Book {

    String title
    String author

    static constraints = {
        author nullable: true
    }
}
--

Activate use in your gsp's with:

[source,html]
--
<grooscript:remoteModel domainClass="Book"/>
--

In the _domainClass_ you have to put the name of the domain class annotated with _@Resource_. The code of the domain
class is converted to javascript, and you can use properties and methods in the client. If you want to
see in action, please take a look at this link:rest-demo.html[guide].
