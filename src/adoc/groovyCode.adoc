[[_groovyCode]]
== <grooscript:code>

You can put your Groovy code in gsp's using this tag.
The groovy code is converted to javascript code and inserted in your page with a _asset.script_ tag.
In Groovy code inside, maybe Grails can try use it, for example if you put '${something}'.
If your code use other sources of your application, then that dependency will be converted too.
A little cleanup is done in generated code, if your code references something that don't find in the context,
then be sure will be available in execution time in the client side.

Generated code is prepared to run with other generated code, not for be called from javascript. For example if you create a
function that expects a groovy map, then you can have problems if a javascript object is passed. There is no problem with
strings or numbers, but if you get a javascript array or object, then no groovy map and list functions. Also if you convert
an object, and you want to create in your javascript code, _var item = new Item();_ doesn't work, you have to do
_var item = Item();_. All goes smooth if you do all in Groovy, for example converting a script like:

<grooscript:code>
    def sing = { name ->
        console.log 'Singing...' + name
    }

    def doSomething = { mapOfClosures ->
        mapOfClosures.each { key, value ->
            value(key)
        }
    }

    $(document).ready doSomething([groovy: sing, grails: sing, grooscript: sing])
